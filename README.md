# File Extension Changer

* encrypt.py and decrypt.py should be in the directory where your files you want to hide are stored.
* encrypt.py changes the extention on the multimedia file
* decrypt.py changes the modified extention to the original one.

* Note: the above scripts only change the extention of the files and doesn't encrypt them
